# We moved this to erbium on Jan 30, and recently have been noticing
# erratic graphs.  Moving sqstat back here to see if this move was the
# cause of the problem.  Also, since we want to replace udp2log with
# kafkatee soon, hopefully we will be able to get rid of the lossy
# multicast udp2log relay and just rely on Kafka, and then get rid
# of emery altogether.
